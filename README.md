# Concert Ticket Reservation System

### Introduction:
The Concert Ticket Reservation System was designed to help users book tickets to local concerts. The key objec-tives of this system are to manage ticket sales, concert in-formation, user reviews, promotion schedules, and staff management. Inspired by connecting audiences with local artists, the project allows users to centralize their concert experience by enabling finding concerts, buying tickets, and sharing experiences through reviews using a graphical user interface (GUI), tkinter.
Additional to a user view, the system also enables staff to centralize their management practices using an admin view. The overarching goal of this system was to improve the general concert experience for both users and staff.
